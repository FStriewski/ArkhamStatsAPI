# ArkhamStatsAPI

Backend that, together with a non-public scraper, retrieves and stores anonymised user statistics from [ArkhamDB](https://arkhamdb.com/) to deduct the popularity of [Arkham LCG](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/) game content. By using daily statistics, traffic on the main page is reduced, anonymity is guaranteed and a sufficent granularity is accomplished.
